# Machine Learning Season Classification Project

This repository contains an academic machine learning project that classifies
days into seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) based on environmental data.

## Project Overview
A toy dataset was designed using weather-related features such as minimum and
maximum temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed. A machine learning
model was trained to group days into seasonal categories.

## Key Tasks
- Dataset design and preparation
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- Machine learning model training and testing
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Model serialization using pickle

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Pickle

## Notes
This project was completed as part of an academic assessment for Machine Learning
with Python.
The trained model is included in serialized (.pkl) format.
